# OS specific
GitHub Actions' `Upload Artifact` action registers an artifact using the name specified with the `name` input.
Because duplicate artifact names are not allowed, we must use a unique name.

This solution is straightforward.

```yaml
      - name: upload-artifact
        if: ${{ success() }}
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: UberJar-${{ runner.os }}
```

For example, it will upload by followings.

- UberJar-Windows
- UberJar-macOS

## GUI unit testing which specific windows
These test codes depend on a Windows-specific Java GUI and therefore do not work on the Ubuntu runner.
I run them only on the Windows runner.  While the Windows runner is more expensive than the Ubuntu runner,
it's less expensive than the macOS runner.  Furthermore, I only use public repositories, so no payment is necessary.

## Using step summary on Windows runner
I have modified `shell` to bash, and redirect result to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.

```yaml
        run: |
          ./gradlew anyPrintTask >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
        shell: bash
```
